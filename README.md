## Bio

I'm currently a Ph.D. candidate in physics at the University of Minnesota studying complex materials. 
Right now I am studying [spontaneously broken](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spontaneous_symmetry_breaking) [chiral](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chirality) symmetry in [nematic liquid crystals](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liquid_crystal#).
A preprint of my latest paper can be found [here on the Arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15083).

## Code Samples
